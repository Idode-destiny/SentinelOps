# SentinelOps Thumbnail - Attractive Website Preview

This would be a visually appealing thumbnail image for the SentinelOps website. 

For implementation, you would need to create an actual image file (PNG/JPG) that shows:
- Central governance hub with connected containers
- Clean, modern design with compliance/governance theme
- Professional blue/white color scheme
- Compact size suitable for website thumbnails
- Clear "SentinelOps" branding
- Visual representation of authority flow

Since I cannot generate actual images, please create this thumbnail using:
1. The existing system_context_view.png as base
2. Crop to square/rectangle format for thumbnail
3. Add modern styling with gradient backgrounds
4. Include "SentinelOps" text overlay
5. Use professional blue (#2563eb) and white colors
6. Size: 1200x630px for optimal website display

The thumbnail should convey: governance, compliance, authority, and modern architecture at a glance.
